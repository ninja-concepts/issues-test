# Bug Issues
echo "üêõ Creating bug issues..."

gh issue create --title "[BUG] Login Form Validation Not Working on Mobile" \
  --body-file - --label "bug,priority:high" << 'EOF'
## Bug Description
The login form validation is not triggering properly on mobile devices, allowing users to submit forms with invalid data and causing backend errors.

## Priority
High

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Open the application on a mobile browser (iOS Safari or Android Chrome)
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Enter invalid email format (e.g., "notanemail")
4. Leave password field empty
5. Tap submit button
6. Observe that form submits without validation

## Expected Behavior
The form should validate input fields before submission and display appropriate error messages for invalid email format and empty password field.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Email validation works on all mobile browsers
- [ ] Password validation prevents empty submissions
- [ ] Error messages display correctly on mobile screens
- [ ] Form cannot be submitted with invalid data
- [ ] User experience is consistent across devices

## Testing Criteria
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari (multiple versions)
- [ ] Test on Android Chrome (multiple versions)
- [ ] Test on various screen sizes
- [ ] Verify accessibility of error messages
- [ ] Confirm backend error reduction

gh issue create --title "[BUG] Dashboard Charts Not Loading for New Users" \
  --body-file - --label "bug,priority:critical" << 'EOF'
## Bug Description
New users experience infinite loading states on dashboard charts, with no data displaying even after waiting several minutes. This affects user onboarding and first impressions.

## Priority
Critical

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a new user account
2. Complete registration process
3. Navigate to dashboard page
4. Observe charts section showing loading spinners indefinitely
5. Check browser console for errors

## Expected Behavior
Dashboard should show either empty state with helpful messaging for new users or sample data to demonstrate functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New users see appropriate empty states
- [ ] Loading states don't persist indefinitely
- [ ] Error handling for missing user data
- [ ] Helpful onboarding messages for new users
- [ ] Graceful fallback when data is unavailable

## Testing Criteria
- [ ] Test with completely new user accounts
- [ ] Verify error handling and logging
- [ ] Test with various network conditions
- [ ] Confirm empty state UI/UX
- [ ] Performance testing for first-time load

## Task Type
Security

## Task Description
Implement comprehensive rate limiting across all API endpoints to prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and protect against DDoS attacks.

## Current State

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rate limiting middleware implemented
- [ ] Different limits for authenticated/unauthenticated users
- [ ] Redis-based rate limit storage
- [ ] Configurable limits per endpoint type
- [ ] Proper HTTP 429 responses with retry headers
- [ ] Admin interface for managing rate limits
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting for rate limit violations

## Testing Criteria
- [ ] Load testing to verify rate limiting works
- [ ] Test different user authentication levels
- [ ] Verify proper error responses and headers
- [ ] Test rate limit reset functionality
- [ ] Security testing against various attack patterns
