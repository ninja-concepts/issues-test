# GitHub Issues + Projects Workflow Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of GitHub's native Issues and Projects workflow, showing how developers can manage tasks, features, and bugs seamlessly within the GitHub ecosystem. This project showcases issue templates, project automation, and Git Flow integration that keeps developers in their natural environment.

> **Note**: The TypeScript/Node.js code in this repository is purely for CI/CD demonstration purposes. The real value lies in the **templates, automation, and workflow integration**.

## üéØ What This Demonstrates

- **Issue Templates**: Structured, validated templates for Features, Bugs, and Technical tasks
- **Automatic Project Management**: Issues automatically appear on project boards with proper categorization
- **Commit-Driven Workflow**: Git commit messages advance issue status without manual updates
- **Seamless Integration**: Everything happens within GitHub - no context switching between tools
- **Developer-Centric Automation**: Workflows designed around how developers actually work

## üöÄ Quick Start for Developers

### 1. Clone and Explore
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd issues-test

# Install dependencies (for CI/CD demo only)
npm install
```

### 2. Try the Workflow
1. **Create an Issue**: Use one of the issue templates (Feature, Bug, or Technical)
2. **Create a Branch**: Follow the naming convention `feature/issue-123-description`
   - Issue automatically moves to "In Progress" when branch is pushed
3. **Develop**: Write code, make commits with proper messages
4. **Create PR**: Link to the issue with `Closes #123` in the description
5. **Watch Magic**: Issue automatically moves to "Dev Complete" when PR merges

### 3. Observe the Automation
- New issues automatically appear on the project board
- Branch creation moves issues to "In Progress" status
- Commit messages with `Closes #123` trigger status updates
- Priority labels automatically update project fields
- Testing workflows activate with label changes

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Workflow

### Creating Issues
Use the provided templates for consistency:

- **üé® Feature Request** (`feature.yml`): New functionality with design requirements
- **üêõ Bug Report** (`bug.yml`): Issues with reproduction steps and priority
- **üîß Technical Task** (`technical.yml`): Refactoring, infrastructure, security work

Each template includes:
- Required fields that ensure completeness
- Automatic project board assignment
- Priority and estimation fields
- Dependency tracking

### Branch Management
Follow Git Flow conventions:
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/issue-123-user-authentication

# Bug fixes  
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-456-login-validation

# Hotfixes
git checkout -b hotfix/issue-789-security-patch
```

### Commit Messages That Work
Your commit messages automatically advance issue status:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement user login system

Add JWT-based authentication with session management
- Create login/logout endpoints
- Add middleware for route protection
- Implement token refresh mechanism

Closes #123"
```

When this commit is merged via PR, issue #123 automatically moves to "Dev Complete" status.

### Pull Request Integration
Create PRs that link to issues:
- Use `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`, or `Resolves #789` in PR description
- Follow the PR template checklist
- CI automatically runs tests, linting, and builds
- Issues advance through workflow stages automatically

## üé® Issue Templates Deep Dive

### Feature Request Template
Perfect for new functionality with stakeholder input:
- **Figma Link**: Design specifications (required)
- **Design Approval**: Checkbox for design team sign-off  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear requirements for completion
- **Story Points**: Fibonacci estimation (1,2,3,5,8,13)
- **Dependencies**: Links to blocking issues

### Bug Report Template  
Structured bug reporting with priority handling:
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low (automatically updates project board)
- **Reproduction Steps**: Numbered, clear steps to reproduce
- **Expected vs Actual Behavior**: Clear problem definition
- **Testing Criteria**: How to verify the fix works

### Technical Task Template
For internal development work:
- **Task Type**: Refactoring, Infrastructure, Security, Documentation
- **Current State ‚Üí Desired State**: Clear before/after definition
- **Technical Requirements**: Specific implementation details
- **Testing Strategy**: How to validate technical changes

## ‚öôÔ∏è Automation in Action

### Issue Lifecycle
1. **Created** ‚Üí Automatically added to project board as "Backlog"
2. **Branch Created** ‚Üí Moves to "In Progress" when Git Flow branch is created (e.g., `feature/issue-123-*`)
3. **Labeled** ‚Üí Priority automatically updated based on labels
4. **PR Linked** ‚Üí Stays in current status during development
5. **PR Merged** ‚Üí Moves to "Dev Complete" when commit contains `Closes #123`
6. **Testing** ‚Üí Manual move to testing, or automated via labels
7. **Done** ‚Üí Closed automatically or manually

### Branch Creation Automation
Creating branches with Git Flow naming automatically updates issue status:
- `feature/issue-123-description` ‚Üí Moves issue #123 to "In Progress"
- `bugfix/issue-456-fix-name` ‚Üí Moves issue #456 to "In Progress"
- `hotfix/issue-789-urgent-fix` ‚Üí Moves issue #789 to "In Progress"

This happens automatically via GitHub Actions when you push new branches to the repository.

### Commit Message Automation
These commit message patterns trigger automatic issue advancement:
- `Closes #123` ‚Üí Moves issue to "Dev Complete"
- `Fixes #456` ‚Üí Moves issue to "Dev Complete"  
- `Resolves #789` ‚Üí Moves issue to "Dev Complete"

### Priority Label Automation
Adding these labels automatically updates project priority fields:
- `priority:critical` ‚Üí Critical priority
- `priority:high` ‚Üí High priority
- `priority:medium` ‚Üí Medium priority
- `priority:low` ‚Üí Low priority

## üìä Project Board Configuration

### Custom Fields

- **`develop`** - Integration branch for features  
- **`feature/*`** - New features and enhancements
- **`bugfix/*`** - Bug fixes for develop
- **`hotfix/*`** - Critical production fixes
- **`release/*`** - Release preparation

### Protection Rules
Both main and develop branches require:
- Pull request reviews (minimum 1 approval)
- All CI status checks passing
- Conversation resolution
- No direct pushes allowed

### Workflow Commands
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/issue-123-new-feature

# Make changes, commit with proper message
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature

Detailed description of changes made

Closes #123"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/issue-123-new-feature
gh pr create --title "feat: implement new feature" --body "Closes #123"
```
